  # This option defines the first version of NixOS you have installed on this particular machine,

  # even if you've upgraded your system to a new NixOS release.

  # This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your packages and OS are pulled from,

  # to actually do that.
  #
  # This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your system is

  # Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes it would make to your configuration,
